# Processing_Sim21_CS_data
This dataset was collected by Islam et al [1] in 2021. This dataset encompasses five distinct VR simulations, designed to represent a wide array of common immersive VR navigation and interaction approaches.  During the VR immersions, HR (1Hz), GSR (4Hz), eye-tracking (30 Hz), and head-tracking data were collected from participants.  Throughout the simulations, Fast Motion Sickness Scale (FMS) scores were recorded every 30 seconds as ground truth, while the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was administered before and after the simulations to assess changes in motion sickness symptoms.
